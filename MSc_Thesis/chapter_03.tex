\chapter{DATA ANALYSIS}\label{ch3}

The first section of this chapter includes an overview of the simulation of the proton-proton collisions which is used in the the second part for the prospects of Higgs boson pair measurement at the HL-LHC.

\section{Simulation and Reconstruction of Proton-Proton Collisions}

Simulation of a pp collision starts by describing the hard interactions which is done by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. A number of different methods are used in these simulations in order to model the matrix element, consequently the cross section of the process of interest. In this thesis, signal ($gg \rightarrow HH$) samples are generated using Powheg v2 \cite{Nason2004, Frixione2007, Alioli2010, Heinrich2019} at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD including the full top mass dependence with SM parameters, and subsequent decays of the Higgs boson pairs into $\tau\tau$, $WW$ and $ZZ$ each with a photon pair is implemented using PYTHIA 8.212 \cite{Sjstrand2015}.
