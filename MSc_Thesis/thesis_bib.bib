The method works for theories that were known to be renormalizable as well as for Yang-Mills type theories. Overlapping divergencies are disentangled. The procedure respects unitarity, causality and allows shifts of integration variables. In non-anomalous cases also Ward identities are satisfied at all stages. It is transparent when anomalies, such as the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly, may occur.},

	abstract = {From a search for electron pairs produced in pp collisions at s = 550 GeV we report the observation of eight events which we interpret as resulting from the process p+p→Z0+ anything, followed by the decay Z0→e++e− or Z0→e++e−+γ, where Z0 is the neutral Intermediate Vector Boson postulated by the unified electroweak theory. We use four of these events to measure the Z0 mass MZ = 91.9 $\pm$ 1.3 $\pm$ 1.4 (systematic) GeV/c2.},
