I would like to express my deep gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Altan Çakır for his excellent guidance for my pursuit in particle physics and in life. He always tried his best to afford what I needed and showed his support in everything I did. I would like also to thank the Upgrade Performance Studies Group (UPSG) of CMS for their concerned behaviour towards everyone. Every colleague I met in UPSG were great people and with many of them we became friends. Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and my beloved one for all the support they gave me so far.

Finally, I acknowledge the financial support from Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TEAK) under the project number 2018TAEK-A5.H6.F2-21.
