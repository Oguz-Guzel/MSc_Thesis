The method works for theories that were known to be renormalizable as well as for Yang-Mills type theories. Overlapping divergencies are disentangled. The procedure respects unitarity, causality and allows shifts of integration variables. In non-anomalous cases also Ward identities are satisfied at all stages. It is transparent when anomalies, such as the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly, may occur.},

We use four of these events to measure the Z0 mass MZ = 91.9 $\pm$ 1.3 $\pm$ 1.4 (systematic) GeV/c2.},
